How to hash passwords in PHP?

## Grok Response:
Use `password_hash()` to hash passwords and `password_verify()` to verify them. Example:

```php
// Hashing a password
$password = "user_password";
$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Verifying a password
if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {
    echo "Password is valid!";
} else {
    echo "Invalid password.";
}
```

## User Prompt (2025-06-11):
Instead of putting Database.php in .gitignore, can we create a config.php file and put that in .gitignore?

## Grok Response:
Yes, you can move sensitive database credentials to a `config.php` file and include it in `.gitignore`.

## User Prompt (2025-06-11):
When adding a game, if the "Other" option is selected for platform, allow the user to input a custom platform, but ensure it doesn't exceed the database limit. Add length validation for all inputs.

## Grok Response:
To allow custom platform input when "Other" is selected and enforce database length limits for all inputs, update the following files:

1. **`add_game.php`** and **`edit_game.php`**:
   - Add a text input (`platform_other`) that appears when "Other" is selected in the platform `<select>` field.
   - Use JavaScript to toggle the visibility of `platform_other` and make it required when "Other" is selected.
   - Add PHP validation for input lengths based on the database schema:
     - `title`: max 100 characters
     - `platform`: max 50 characters
     - `region`: max 50 characters
     - `condition`: max 50 characters
     - `notes`: max 1000 characters
   - Use `maxlength` attributes in HTML inputs for client-side restriction.
   - If "Other" is selected, use the value from `platform_other` as the platform.

2. **`scripts.js`**:
   - Add JavaScript to show/hide `platform_other` based on platform selection.
   - Add client-side validation for input lengths and ensure `platform_other` is filled when "Other" is selected.
   - Validate `purchase_price` for non-negative values.

## User Prompt (2025-06-11):
For each input field in game forms (add/edit), add short descriptive tooltips that appear on hover to clarify what to enter (e.g., explain region, condition). Use dropdowns for region and condition to guide users.

## Grok Response:
To add tooltips and improve clarity for input fields:
1. **Tooltips**:
   - Add `title` attribute to all form elements (`input`, `select`, `textarea`) in `add_game.php` and `edit_game.php` with short descriptions (e.g., "Game Title: The name of the game (e.g., Super Mario Bros)").
2. **Dropdowns**:
   - Replace `region` with a `<select>` containing common regions (NTSC-U, PAL, NTSC-J) with an "Other" option and a dynamic `region_other` text field.
   - Replace `condition` with a `<select>` containing common conditions (New, Used, Damaged) with an "Other" option and a dynamic `condition_other` text field.
   - Update PHP in `add_game.php` and `edit_game.php` to handle `region_other` and `condition_other` inputs when "Other" is selected.
3. **Validation**:
   - Keep existing length validations (title: 100 chars, platform: 50 chars, region: 50 chars, condition: 50 chars, notes: 1000 chars).
   - Update `scripts.js` to manage dynamic fields (`region_other`, `condition_other`) and validate inputs client-side.

## User Prompt (2025-06-11):
The table in games.php after Total Collection Value has poor contrast; text blends with the background. The white background looks bad, possibly due to my browser's dark theme. Can we plan for both light and dark themes?

## Grok Response:
To address the contrast issue and white background in `games.php`:
1. **Table Contrast**:
   - Updated `games.php` to use `table-dark` and a custom `custom-table` class.
   - Set table background to dark gray (`#343a40`), text to light gray (`#e9ecef`), and headers to retro dark blue (`#1a2b3c`) with white text (`#ffffff`).
   - Added distinct borders (`#495057`) for better readability.
2. **Background**:
   - Changed `body` background to light gray (`#f8f9fa`) for light theme and dark gray (`#212529`) for dark theme.
   - Updated `.container` to have a white background (`#ffffff`) in light theme and dark gray (`#343a40`) in dark theme.
3. **Dark Theme Support**:
   - Added `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in `custom.css` to adjust colors for dark theme users.
   - Ensured high contrast in both themes (e.g., white text on dark backgrounds in dark mode).
4. **Retro Theme**:
   - Maintained Press Start 2P font and added retro-inspired colors (e.g., `#1a2b3c` for headers).
   - Added subtle hover effects on table rows for better UX.
Updated files: `games.php` and `css/custom.css`.

## User Prompt (2025-06-11):
The new design for games.php is great! The previous green palette felt more retro. Also, the table overflows from the My Game Collections area (see attached image).

## Grok Response:
Thank you for the feedback! To address your points:
1. **Green Palette**:
   - Updated `css/custom.css` to use a retro green palette (`#2e7d32` for light theme headers, `#1b5e20` for dark theme table, `#66bb6a` for dark theme headers).
   - Applied green tones to buttons, table headers, and borders for a retro Game Boy/NES vibe.
2. **Table Overflow**:
   - Added `table-responsive` to `games.php` to prevent overflow on narrow screens.
   - Increased margin between "My Retro Game Collection" and the table (`mb-5`) and set a `max-width` on `.container` for better layout control.
Updated files: `games.php` and `css/custom.css`.

## User Prompt (2025-06-11 09:29 PM +03):
Can we make the "My Retro Game Collection" area bigger so we donâ€™t need to scroll?

## Grok Response:
To make the "My Retro Game Collection" area bigger and avoid scrolling:
1. **Header Size**:
   - Increased `h2` to `display-4` with a custom `font-size: 3.5rem` and added a retro shadow effect.
2. **Layout Optimization**:
   - Set `.container` `max-width` to 1400px and added `min-height: 100vh` with flexbox to utilize full screen height.
   - Added `w-100` to the table and optimized `table-responsive` for full width.
3. **Table Adjustments**:
   - Reduced padding and adjusted row height for more content visibility.
   - Ensured responsive design with `@media (max-width: 768px)` for mobile.
Updated files: `games.php` and `css/custom.css`.
